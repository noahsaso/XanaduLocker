# XanaduLocker

I got tired of always clicking the same buttons when purchasing lockers at [Xanadu Roller Arts](https://www.xanadu.nyc/), so I made this Safari Extension that autofills your code on the locker purchase page and skips to the final checkout section quickly. Autofill is trigerred once you hit the initial Confirm button.

## Usage

1. Install the app via Xcode.

2. Set your code in the app.

3. Go to a locker purchase page by scanning the QR code at Xanadu.

4. Enable the extension in Safari settings.

5. Accept the prompt to allow the extension to run on all gopod.mobi URLs.

6. Autofill is triggered when you press Confirm.
